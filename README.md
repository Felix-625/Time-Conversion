# Time-Conversion


This code takes a time input in 12-hour AM/PM format as a string extracts the hour, minutes, and seconds components, checks whether the time is in the AM or PM period, adjusts the hour accordingly to convert it to 24-hour (military) format—setting the hour to `00` for 12 AM and adding 12 for PM hours other than 12—and finally returns and prints the reformatted time string in 24-hour format (e.g., `"19:05:45"`).
